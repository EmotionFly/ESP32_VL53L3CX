 * i2c_drv.c - i2c driver implementation
 *
 * @note
 * For some reason setting CR1 reg in sequence with
 * I2C_AcknowledgeConfig(I2C_SENSORS, ENABLE) and after
 * I2C_GenerateSTART(I2C_SENSORS, ENABLE) sometimes creates an
 * instant start->stop condition (3.9us long) which I found out with an I2C
 * analyzer. This fast start->stop is only possible to generate if both
 * start and stop flag is set in CR1 at the same time. So i tried setting the CR1
 * at once with I2C_SENSORS->CR1 = (I2C_CR1_START | I2C_CR1_ACK | I2C_CR1_PE) and the
 * problem is gone. Go figure...
